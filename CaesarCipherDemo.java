         * A Scanner object parses primitive types and Strings from a stream.
         * 
         * A stream is a sequence of characters from a file, String, terminal,
         *      network connection, etc.
         *      
         * Parsing is separating a sequence of characters into tokens based on
         *      delimiters.
         *      A token is a meaningful sequence of characters (e.g., word).
         *      Delimiters are characters that separate tokens
         *          (by default, whitespace (space, tab, newline) is the delimiter).
         *          
         * When we create a Scanner object, we have to specify the input stream
         *      (e.g., System.in which is the keyboard via the terminal).
